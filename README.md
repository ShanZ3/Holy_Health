Holy Health
============================

By Shan Zhong <br>
For 2019 Fall DH150 User Experience Design final project <br>

## Design Problem
> With the development of Internet medical and wearable medical devices, more and more people are willing to record and manage their own health data through their smartphones. The health app not only spreads a lot of health knowledge, but also provides a variety of services, including setting reminders, recording and analysis functions for medical device use, and online consultation for professional doctors. These services can solve the doubts encountered in life without leaving home, so its emergence is in line with the development of the times and market demand. The main design purpose for this project is to improve the user experience of the product in visual design and meet the user's demand for personalized, artistic and comfortable product design.
